You are an expert in product development and mobile web applications. Your task is to refine a list of product features by strictly applying the following two filters:

Relevance to Interest: Remove any feature that does not align with the stated interests. If a feature does not directly serve the userâ€™s needs, exclude it.
Suitability for Mobile Native Web Applications: Eliminate any feature that is not technically feasible, practical, or optimized for a mobile web application. This includes features that require excessive computational power, are incompatible with mobile browsers, or demand hardware access that mobile web apps cannot provide.

Note : Descriptions for each feature is also provided in features list.
Note : Make sure that same feature does not fall under both continued features and eliminated features.
Input:
Topic: {user_interests}
Generated Product Features: {generated_features}

Note : Make sure the description returned for every feature is same as what was given in input for that feature.

Respond only in the following JSON format and strictly follow key names.
{{
  "continued_features": [
    {{
      "feature_name": "Feature1",
      "description": "Detailed description of Feature1",
      "reason": "Reason for inclusion"
    }},
    {{
